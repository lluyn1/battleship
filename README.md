Battleship
=========

Using: html, CSS, javascript, jQuery

評論:
- Positions are set automatically, you cannot set them yourself
- Computer chooses positions automatically, which means every time it catches your ship, it will not finish the ship off, which is supposed to make winning simple.
- Templates are mainly in html.

- 10*10的格子，船：1隻4格的，2隻3格的，3隻2格的，3隻1格的。你和電腦都這樣。
